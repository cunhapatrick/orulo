## General info

The project is a mercado livre clone, that has just some features related with
the e-commerce:

- Has some filters that can be applied by the user, ex: like select which category (source) the user want;
- Can order the products ascending or descending by title;
- Can search for keywords;
- Can paginate throught the selected products (or by all if no filter is applied);
- Has a login/signup system that is stored on the localStorage of the browser;
- The user can select favorites products and can see the list on another page of the project;
  P.S: Because of the limitation of the free graphql API's, I load all the data inside the redux, and I do all the process's of pagination on the client-side.
